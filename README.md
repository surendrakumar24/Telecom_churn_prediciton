Telecom_churn_prediciton using PCA and Logistic Regression

# following steps followed to build the model:

1. Preprocessed data (convert columns to appropriate formats, handle missing values, etc.)

2. Conducted appropriate exploratory analysis to extract useful insights (whether directly useful for business or for eventual modelling/feature engineering).

3. Derived new features.

4. Reduced the number of variables using PCA.

5. Trained a variety of models, tuned model hyperparameters, etc. (handle class imbalance using appropriate techniques).

6. Evaluated the models using appropriate evaluation metrics. Note that is more important to identify churners than the non-churners 
accurately - choose an appropriate evaluation metric which reflects this business goal.

7. Finally, choosen a model based on some evaluation metric.
